How to run the code?
first copy the code from "Main.java" file in the zip and paste the code in any java compiler based on the steps provided below run the code,
The provided code simulates a turn-based combat game between two players, Player A and Player B. Here's a summary of how the code works:
1.	It prompts the user to input the health, strength, and attack values for both Player A and Player B.
2.	It determines which player will start the attack based on their initial health.
3.	It enters a loop where each iteration represents a round of combat.
4.	In each round, it rolls dice for both attack and defence.
5.	It calculates the attack damage and defence strength for the attacking and defending players respectively.
6.	It deducts the damage from the defending player's health if the attack is successful.
7.	It switches the attacking player for the next round.
8.	It repeats the process until the health of either player reaches zero or below.
9.	Finally, it prints the result of the game, indicating which player lost.
The code also includes additional print statements to display the values of attack dice, defence dice, attack damage, and defence strength for each round, providing more insight into the combat mechanics.

The unit test cases for the code is in word document you can refer that document.
